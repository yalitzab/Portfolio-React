        My desired roles are Full-stack web development, Back-end web development, or Freelance. 
        Coming from the workforce solutions industry, I have found web development as new talent 
        and have passion for creativity in HTML, JavaScript to develop fully functional complex code. 
        I have a certificate in Full-Stack Web development from UCLA. The intense robust but rewarding bootcamp 
        program prepared me to develop web applications from the Front-end to the Back-end to provide solutions to businesses and clients.
